            <p>CHAANV WELFARE believes that until and unless members of the civil society are involved actively in the process of change and development, nothing can happen. 
             To make this change happen, we invite you to come and be part of the Save the Children volunteer program, come and join us to work for the welfare of poor children and underprivileged children and their families.
             We truly believe that volunteers are the backbone of every organization not only do they carry the organization’s ideals within them and help the organization in implementing them on the ground, they also spread the message far and beyond, sensitizing the society towards the cause.<br>

            As we continue to fight against Covid, there are many who have suffered from loss. Loss of life, loss of income, loss of 
            financial security, and the subsequent consequences of these losses. There are many families in which breadwinners 
            lost their jobs due to the pandemic or breadwinners lost their lives to the pandemic. We are committed to ensuring that each 
            child in need gets a fair chance at education and no adversity should result in a child having to discontinue their education.
             We are here to provide scholarship support to children and youth to continue their education and pursue their dreams.
             <br><br>
             Who is eligible for the scholarship?
<ul>
<li>Any child and youth between the ages of 4 and 21</li>
<li>Children where breadwinner(s) in the family have lost their job or lives</li></ul>
<br>
Chaanv Welfare is striving to sponsor school and college education for as many children from underprivileged 
backgrounds as possible by providing them with scholarships.<br> By making a small donation of Rs. 1,000, you can help us
 provide a better and a more secure future for an economically disadvantaged child.
